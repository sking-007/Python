# Python

Using Python Sockets, create an application that allows a remote client to send commands to a server component to get employee details.
Client:
Develop a menu-driven console-based program (using Sockets) that will allow the user to get information about the modules offered at MTU. Of the query data listed, only the learning outcomes can be edited by the user.
Example run:
Module System 1.0

1.	Evaluate and apply design patterns in the design and development of a distributed system.
2.	Assess and apply different architectural patterns in a distributed system.
3.	Critically access and apply threading in a distributed application.
4.	Debug a distributed client/server application, identifying object properties and variables at run-time.
5.	Create a distributed object application using RMI, allowing client/server to communicate securely via interfaces and objects.

Server:
Using Socket programming, accept a connection from a client and handle the options given in the example run, i.e.
•	Verify the existence of a module id. The client sends a value such as “SOFT8009” and we return
a Boolean result.
•	Knowing the employee id is valid, now it can receive commands and options.
•	The server must also be able to send back a “not recognised” response for invalid commands /
options (and the client must handle it).
•	Use 1 or more data structures (hard coded is fine) to store some module details. Lists, dictionaries or whatever you want can be used. You could use tinydb for a JSON file, but it is not necessary. 

Modify the sockets server program to handle multiple simultaneous client connections.

It would be good to keep track of access to the system (i.e . an activity log). Modify the server so that each time a request is received for a module, a message is sent to a message queue with the module id, the command and options sent from the client, as well as IP address details. Then write a simple script to print out the activity log details. Use RabbitMQ. There is very similar functionality in the Darts application – see lab05.pdf for the stats example.
Put the server into a Docker container.

Messaging
Use of RabbitMQ to consume stats/logs and output them

Sockets
Client and Server classes using a socket for 2-way communication

Threading
A multi-threaded application to cope with many clients

Docker
Server component Dockerfile creates an image and runs as a container
